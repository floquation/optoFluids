Double slit experiment, used to validate the optics code with the exact Fraunhofer (near-axis and far-field) solution.

input_doubleSlit uses merely two spheres with a separation of 0.2.
input_longSlit comprises 299 particles with a separation of 0.2 between successive particles.
input_longDoubleSlit comprises 301 particles per slit with a separation of 2.0 between the slits and a separation of 0.2 between successive particles within each slit.
