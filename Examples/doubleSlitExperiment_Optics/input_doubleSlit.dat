! Rules:
! All items should be on a separate line.
! Vectors start with a '(' and end with a ')', space-separated.
! A line starting with a '!' indicates a comment-line.
! Maximum length of a line = 250, but no line continuation is supported. The same applies to filenames.

! This is the "double slit" case of the validation of March10.
